#### Achievement summary

To date I have implemented the projection of the stent struts to the carpet view. I have spent most of the time investigating the VTK library so I was a little pushed by time so that current solution may be less optimal than it ideally could be. As it requires a much more work on architecture in order to make the program more efficient, I suppose that current result is optimal considering the time of implementation and application performance. I must stress that app uses external trusted libraries wherever possible in order to assure its own stability and correctness.

#### Screenshots
Here you may see the screenshot of the carpet view with the stent struts of four different types.
