Unforuntately, the currently used combination of algorithms does not seem to work well when putting markers inside the lumina on the dark regions, that are very similar to other vessel parts by colour.
So I have to decide whether to change the tactics and try model-based strategy or to go on with canny and watershed and add the vessel contour to the image and see what happens.
