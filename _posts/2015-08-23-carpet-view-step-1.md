### Achievement summary

To the date I have implemented the creation of the canvas for the carpet view as well as calculation of the vessel cross sections and stent-strut contours perimeters. Creation of the canvas includes rendering of the carpet view, currently without stent struts themselves, though.

### Screenshots

On the diagram there is quite a big difference between the perimeters of the stent-strut contours and vessel cross sections, so shanshots of the first four OCT frames are included below in order to explain what dictated the acquired result.
