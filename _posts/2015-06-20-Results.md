#### Short post about the results
Fortunately, area detection is now available and I still meet the schedule.

Unfortunately, I can not provide any kind of good explanation on how to fix the problem I described in the previous post. But after some changes in my code it simply disappeared _=)_.

Also I have to thank Aleh for very valuable explanation on how the watershed algorithm works and how to preprocess image.
So that's all I would like to say in this post. Let's move on!
